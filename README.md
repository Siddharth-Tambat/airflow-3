# Airflow Repository  

This repository demonstrates key concepts and best practices in **Apache Airflow** for building, orchestrating, and monitoring data pipelines.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Covered Concepts  

### 1. **DAG and Task Decorators**  
- Learn how to define DAGs and tasks using the `@dag` and `@task` decorators.  
- Enables cleaner and more Pythonic DAG definitions.  

### 2. **Task Branching**  
- Implement conditional workflows using `BranchPythonOperator` or branching with the TaskFlow API.  
- Example: Run different downstream tasks based on validation results.  

### 3. **Task Grouping**  
- Organize tasks into logical groups using `TaskGroup`.  
- Improves DAG readability and helps manage complex pipelines.  

### 4. **XComs**  
- Share data between tasks using **XCom (Cross-Communication)**.  
- Example: Pass API response metadata from extraction to transformation tasks.  

### 5. **Assets**  
- Treat datasets and external systems as **first-class assets** in Airflow.  
- Enables better lineage tracking and asset-based scheduling.
